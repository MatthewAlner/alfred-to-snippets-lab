# Alfred to SnippetsLab

> This isn't finished yet, check back later or feel free to pick up where I left off ❤️

The idea here is to create a script to convers `Alfred's` JSON snippet format into the compatible import format for `SnippetLab`

// TODO

- Finish the basics
- Stop hard coding the Alfred path, have it so you can pass it in.
- Save SnippetLab Collection JSON as file not just console log.
